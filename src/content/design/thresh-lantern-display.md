This is a 3D‑printed display inspired by Thresh’s lantern. I modeled the parts for printability, split them into shell components, and added alignment features so everything assembles cleanly after printing. 

Notes
- Printed on FDM in PLA with standard 0.2 mm layer height
- Parts were oriented to minimize supports and preserve surface finish
- Post‑processed with light sanding and assembly fasteners

I’ll add a few photos and the source files later. If you want specific dimensions or print settings included here, tell me and I’ll document them.
