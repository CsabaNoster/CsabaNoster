This is a 3D‑printed display build of Viego’s iconic sword. The model is split into printable sections with index features to keep assembly accurate.

Notes
- Designed for typical 0.2 mm layer height on FDM
- Sections keyed to prevent twist; light sanding required before joining
- Space reserved for optional clear resin accents or LEDs later

I’ll add photos, dimensions, and print settings after I upload the gallery. If you want a downloadable pack (STL/STEP/ZIP), say the word and I’ll add a button and URL.
