## Nema17 Actuator (2024) — Planetary Gear Drive

A compact, high‑torque planetary gear actuator built around a standard NEMA 17 stepper. It uses a 38.4:1 reduction for smooth motion and strong output, with parts optimized for desktop 3D printing and straightforward assembly.

### Specifications

- Gear ratio: 38.4:1
- Motor: NEMA 17 stepper (standard 42 mm face)


### Tools

- Soldering iron (for leads/connectors if needed)
- Hex key set (M3)

### Materials & Consumables

- 3D filament, 1.75 mm, 1 kg spool, ±0.02 mm (PLA+ recommended; ABS or PA‑CF for higher temp/rigidity)
- Synthetic grease (e.g., Permatex) for gear stages and raceways

### Bearings / Rolling Elements

- 6 mm balls — 31 pcs
- Compatible with 6 mm plastic airsoft BBs (quieter, lighter) or 6 mm chrome steel balls (stiffer, longer life)

### Hardware

- M3×8 mm socket head screws — 8 pcs
- M4 hex nuts — 4 pcs
- Assorted M3 nuts/washers (keep on hand for covers/preload)

### Heat‑Set Inserts

- M3×6 mm heat‑set inserts — 8 pcs

### Electromechanical

- NEMA 17 stepper motor — 1 pc
- Standard 42 mm face; choose torque/current to match your driver

### Notes & Tips

- Apply a thin film of grease to gears and ball raceways — too much increases drag.
- Ball choice: plastic = quieter/low mass; steel = stiffer/longer wear.
- Printing: start with PLA+ for accuracy; move to ABS/PA‑CF for heat resistance or extra stiffness.
- Inserts: use a temperature‑controlled iron; press straight to avoid skew.
- Fasteners: a dab of medium threadlocker on M3 screws helps against vibration.
