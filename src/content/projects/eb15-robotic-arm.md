5-Axis Robotic Arm

This robotic arm was designed and built entirely from scratch. It has five stepper-driven axes that provide smooth, precise movement and a servo-powered gripper for basic object handling. The control system is based on an Arduino Due and Arduino Mega connected via I2C, with a RAMPS 1.4 board driving the stepper motors.

The arm has a reach of about 50 cm and can lift around 500 g, making it ideal for desktop use, motion control experiments, and learning robotics. Its modular setup allows easy calibration, maintenance, and future upgrades.

Key Features

- 5 degrees of freedom + servo gripper
- Controlled by Arduino Due + Mega via I2C
- RAMPS 1.4 with five stepper drivers
- Powered by a 12â€“24 V DC supply
- Designed for compact and educational use
