This project covers the full build of my EB‑15 collaborative robot arm: mechanism design, custom actuators, wiring, and firmware.

Highlights:
- 5 degrees of freedom with modular joints
- Custom servo/actuator packages
- Arduino‑based controller with real‑time manual control
- Iterative CAD and multiple material tests
